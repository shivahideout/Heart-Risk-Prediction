The increasing prevalence of cardiovascular diseases has highlighted the critical need for timely and effective
health monitoring systems. Traditional methods often lack real-time capabilities, making it challenging to
predict life-threatening events like heart attacks.

• This project presents a cutting-edge solution that integrates wearable technology with machine learning to
provide real-time heart attack predictions. By utilizing smartwatch data, such as heart rate, blood pressure, and
SpO2, collected via the Google Fit API, the system applies advanced machine learning models, including
XGBoost to identify potential health risks.

• The predictive accuracy of over 92% ensures reliable detection of high-risk scenarios.

• A web-based platform complements the system, offering real-time visualizations of health metrics and
automated alerts to emergency contacts via SMS during critical situations. This proactive approach bridges the
gap between conventional health monitoring and modern preventive care.

• Key advantages include non-invasive monitoring, continuous data analysis, and early risk detection,
significantly reducing response times and improving health outcomes. Future enhancements aim to incorporate
additional health indicators, refine prediction models, and support multilingual features, making this solution
more accessible and impactful across diverse populations.

As a proof of concept, this project demonstrates the feasibility of combining technology and healthcare to deliver real-time, personalized, and preventive medical support. However, due to concerns around user data privacy and security—as well as the extensive computational resources required to run advanced machine learning models in real-time—the system has not been deployed publicly.
